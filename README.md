**Contents**
A research project is computationally reproducible if a second investigator (including you in the future) can recreate the final reported results of the project, including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of files and written instructions" (Kitzes et al. 2018). Yet, in daily research practice, creating reproducible workflows requires skills, which are seldom taught in academic curricula. In this workshop, we will discuss about the benefits of creating reproducible workflows, both at the level of the scientific community, and for your mental wellbeing as a researcher (!). We will then explore two useful tools to ensure reproducibility: Version control with Git (and by extension, Github), and computational notebooks such as RMarkdown.

Dr. Francesco Maria Sabatini  
Assistant Professor at University of Bologna, Italy.
