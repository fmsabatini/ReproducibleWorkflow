## A reproducible workflow in your research practice - A gift to your future self

This presentation was prepared by [@fmsabatini](https://github.com/fmsabatini/) for the mini-course *Reproducible workflows in Science* offered to the members of the [Biogeography and Macroecology (BIOME) Lab at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna](https://bigea.unibo.it/it/ricerca/gruppi-di-ricerca/biome)

**Contents**
A research project is computationally reproducible if a second investigator (including you in the future) can recreate the reported results, including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of files and written instructions (Kitzes et al. 2018). Yet, in daily research practice, creating reproducible workflows requires skills, which are seldom taught in academic curricula. In this workshop, we will discuss about the benefits of creating reproducible workflows, both at the level of the scientific community, and for your mental wellbeing as a researcher (!). We will then explore two useful tools to ensure reproducibility: Version control with Git (and by extension, Github), and computational notebooks such as RMarkdown.

**Lecturer**  
Dr. Francesco Maria Sabatini  
Assistant Professor at University of Bologna, Italy.
